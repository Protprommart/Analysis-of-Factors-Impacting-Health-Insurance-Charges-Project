# Analysis of Factors Impacting Health Insurance Charges Project
## <u>Executive Summary</u>
This report aims to analyze the factors influencing health insurance charges, including age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of dependents, smoking status, and U.S. geographic region, through the statistical models of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Robust Regression, Gamma Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), and Tweedie GLMs. Box-Cox and log transformations are applied to stabilize the response variable, which is insurance charges. The factors influencing health insurance are evaluated by positive or negative effects on insurance charges, and whether they are significant or non-significant to insurance charges. The result of the analysis shows that smoking, age, BMI, and more number of dependents are significant to the increase in insurance charges with smoking being the most significant predictor. Locating in the Southwest and Southeast significantly decreases the charges compared to those who reside in the Northwest and Northeast. Female insurance charges significantly increased more than males by a small difference. The key takeaway and insights from this study emphasize the potential for individuals to reduce charges by adopting healthier lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy BMI, and understanding how demographic and regional factors influence their insurance costs. 
  

## <u>Introduction</u>
### Statement of problem
Health care insurance is one of the essential factors for people to receive the treatment they need and maintain their health. However, despite its importance, many Americans find it challenging to afford health insurance due to the rising costs of health care services and insurance premiums. Total health spending in the U.S. has surged at a rate that outpaces inflation, creating financial strain for individuals and families.

Understanding how health insurance companies predict and calculate premium rates is crucial. When individuals gain insight into this process, they can make informed lifestyle choices that may lower their premiums, potentially reducing their overall health costs. This knowledge empowers people to take preventive measures and encourages healthier habits that could contribute to lowering their insurance premiums.

In this analysis, we aim to uncover the relationship between the medical costs billed to health insurance companies and various predictors, including an individualâ€™s age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of dependents, smoking status, and U.S. geographic region. By examining these factors, we hope to shed light on how certain lifestyle and demographic attributes contribute to health insurance costs.

The primary audience for this analysis includes Americans who either pay for their insurance independently or as heads of households responsible for their families' health coverage. Additionally, this report is intended for health insurance professionals and healthcare workers who deal with health insurance daily and might benefit from deeper insights into the variables affecting premium calculations. Understanding these relationships can support better communication with clients and inform policy adjustments that account for various health risks.

### summary of conclusion

The statistical models used for insurance charges analysis include Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Robust Regression, Gamma Generalized  Linear Model (GLM), and Tweedie GLMs, with Box-Cox and log transformations applied to charges.

Smoking emerged as the most significant predictor, substantially increasing charges and interacting with BMI, age, and number of children to reveal nuanced relationships. Age and BMI consistently exhibited positive associations with charges, while the number of children also showed a significant positive effect. Regional differences were mixed, with Southeast and Southwest residents experiencing reduced charges compared to the Northeast. Females incurred slightly higher baseline charges than males, potentially due to healthcare costs specific to women, though this difference was relatively small. 

Practical insights emphasize the importance of managing smoking and BMI to lower charges, while regional and gender differences are less impactful. Future work could address residual heteroscedasticity and explore additional variables like income or pre-existing conditions to refine model accuracy. The Box-Cox Gamma GLM provided the most reliable results, with the Box-Cox Tweedie GLM with smoking interaction terms showing promise for reducing residual heteroscedasticity.
